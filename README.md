## Description 

   In this project, we aim to develop a bi-directional translation system for multiple languages, including Dutch, Japanese, French, Italian, and English. Our focus is on building and comparing various neural network models such as Simple RNN, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Encoder-Decoder models. We will evaluate the performance of these models using metrics like Accuracy, BLEU Score, ROUGE Score, and F1-Score. Additionally, we will explore the use of transfer learning techniques, leveraging pretraining on large-scale multilingual data, to enhance translation quality. By conducting experiments and analyzing results, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of bi-directional translation across multiple languages
